# Linux permissions

Let's practise a little. We'll talk about permissions.

<mark style="background-color:purple;">Remember</mark> that we can use the "`sudo su`" command to become the "`root`" user.

```bash
sudo su
```

If we now used the "`whoami`" command, we would see that we have become the "`root`" user (or superuser inside the machine).

{% hint style="info" %}
Command "whoami" shows you who is currently logged in.
{% endhint %}
